# Finalizing Your Learning Portfolio

1. *What is this purpose of this Git repository? (duh!)*
    A git repository allows you to periodically save your work and see what changes were made between iterations of code; if something goes wrong you can revert ot an earlier version. Also, git allows you to  collaborate on coding projects with a team through the push/pull commands and branches.
    
2. *What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?*
My favorite assignment was probably the final secuirty lab because it was a lab that allowed a lot of room for creativity. At first, I was quite intimidated by the fact that we were going in to "break" someone else's website and thought that all this hacking would require  a much higher skill level than I had. But as I read thought the OWASP Web Application Cheat Sheet and beginning trying to 'hack' into my partner's site I become really invested and excited about trying to find new ways to undermine my partner's site. This lab, more than any other CompSci project I've worked on before, really impressed upon me the power of the web. A couple lines of sneaky code can completely undermine someone else's intent.

3. *How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?*
I came in to this course knowing HTML and CSS but having no idea about javascript and never having worked with APIs before. Leaving this course, I can now say that while I feel far from an expert I definitely feel comfortable sitting down to write a Javascript program. Learning how to read documentation , especially for deciphering MongoDB commands, really helped me figure out what teaching yourself meant in the context of computer science and helped me "learn how to learn"

4. *What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.*
One of the most important things I learned in this course is how to work with APIs and, most importantly, learn to read their documentation to effectively use the API. For example, when I was using trying to find how to only insert the most recent check-in of  a passegner/vehicle on Assignment 3 into the mongoDB I had to read through a lot of mongoDB's documentation to find a method that would both delete replicated entries and insert the new entry to the top of the database.
Another important thing I learned in this course was both that Javascript was asynchronous and how to handle that. For example, in Assignment 2 it was necessary to wait until the browser had recieved the location of the user before sending it to the server (aka Assignment 3).However if you just placed the two commands of asking the user for their location and then sending it to the server one after the other with no conditionals on either of them, the second, send the info to the server, command would run before the computer had finished recording the user's location. So, creating conditionals to ensure the status code was at 400 before moving onto subsequent commands is important.

5.  *Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?*
    My final group project made me excited about the d3 javascript library and I would like to explore more with that.

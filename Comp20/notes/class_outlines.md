# Thursday, January 18th: Course Introduction
* The bad news: course is closed, wait-list
* Why (still) the web?  Why are you here?
* Motivation 1, the first web page (1992): http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html
* Motivation 1A: http://line-mode.cern.ch/www/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html
* Motivation 2: http://www.dolekemp96.org/
* How two computers talk to each other: basic networking
* The Internet vs the World Wide Web

# Tuesday, January 23rd: HTTP
* PSA on sexual harassment
* Last class: the big ideas?
* Recall telephone conversation example
* Telephone extension numbers
* So what is the web?
* Two special computers: web server and web client
* URLs:
  `protocol://domain/<any directories here>/<filename>`
* The big idea of HTTP, how the web works: request-response, similar to Q&A
* Examining HTTP requests and responses on Reddit...
* HTTP commands: GET and POST
  - GET: Download data
  - POST: Upload data, send data to web server
* Demo: Web server
* Q: How to browse web without web browser?
  
# Thursday, January 25th: HTML
* Last class: recall how HTTP works
* Recall question: if no port number is provided, the default port number to connect to on web server is...?
* Recall question: what HTTP command is executed when entering URL address?
* Recall question: if no file is provided in URL, the file with what name is generally served by default?
* To ponder: the best status code to use...?
* Take a look at the HTML
* What is markup?
  - The paragraph analogy
* Motivation: writing
* Block vs. inline elements
* Attributes
* Image --a special tag...
* Anchors
* Absolute vs relative URLs
* What's wrong with the HTML?
* W3C validator

# Tuesday, January 30th: Revision Control with Git
* Last class: HTML => for the content, for document appearance and behavior, W3C validator
* Last class: Two major types of HTML body elements: block level and inline
* Recall question: difference between absolute and relative URLs --which to use for portability?
* Recall question: why is the `alt` attribute necessary for images?
* What I am NOT going to do: discuss every HTML tag
* What is important to discuss: the finer points of HTML
  - #fail
  - Recall last class: what's peculiar about HTML? (hints: closing tags, attributes, nesting)
  - Commandments
* Question: _how do you build a web browser?_
* What I've noticed in the past: many connecting to Tufts CS to do work via SSH, questions on submitting assignments and labs in this class, how to upload web pages to a server
* About file permissions and the HTTP response status code 403
* The nightmare scenario that illustrates the need for revision control: in the past...
* What if I need to hire developers to work on different pieces of a projet?
* Why revision control? Keep track of changes, document changes
* Why Git? Speed, no dependency of a remote server (unlike Subversion)
* Why GitHub for repositories? Network effect, communications
* Example with our course website
* IMPORTANT: you are not expected to master Git by the end of this course.  The reality, even for the most seasoned people: https://twitter.com/ErrataRob/status/707327952158121984

# Thursday, February 1st: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
* Why do you want to separate style?
* One CSS _rule_ is made up of _selectors_ and _declarations_. A declaration is a _property-value_ pair.
  - You really want to refer to a CSS cheat sheet!
* Three types of selectors: HTML tag names, ID, class
  - ID: should only be used once; starts with "#"
  - class: can be used many times; start with "."
  - Mixing IDs and classes is confusing, generally not a good idea.
  - "id" and "class" attribute exist for all HTML elements
  - Generic block HTML element: div
  - Generic inline HTML element: span
* Box model for HTML body elements
* The "cascading" in "cascading style sheet"
  - What if there is more than one style specified for an HTML element?

# Tuesday, February 6th: Responsive Design
* Last class: CSS
* Why CSS?  What do they give you?
* Recall: id vs class
* Recall: what is cascading?
* Loading additional stylesheets
* Today: mobile
* Take out your phone or mobile device.  Go to...
* How mobile web browsers work: render pages in a virtual window (i.e., the viewport), usually wider than the screen, so they don't need to squeeze every page layout into a tiny window. Users can pan and zoom to see different areas of the page.  That is, a mobile browser it will assume that you are viewing a desktop experience and that you want to see all of it.
* `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=0;" />` => your layout will be displayed properly at 1:1 scale.  No zooming will be applied.
* So can I have a different stylesheets for different screen sizes and devices?
  - http://broadcast.oreilly.com/2010/04/using-css-media-queries-ipad.html
* Can I have different rules in a CSS for different screen sizes (e.g., widths)?
* Gmail in the news recently: http://googleappsdeveloper.blogspot.com/2016/09/your-emails-optimized-for-every-screen-with-responsive-design.html
* Your next lab
* Why this technique?

# Thursday, February 8th: JavaScript
* File permissions
* So far, we have covered quite a bit: HTTP, HTML, CSS, Git
* What are the problems and limitations with just HTML and CSS?
* HTTP: stateless protocol, no memory of previous requests
* In the early 90s, "Netscape quickly realized that the Web needed to become more dynamic. Even if you simply wanted to check that users entered correct values in a form, you needed to send the data to the server in order to give feedback." http://speakingjs.com/es5/ch04.html
* Our focus is still on the client-side
* Variables: dynamic typing but will be one of the following: number, string, array, object, boolean
  - Three states of a variable: (1) not set yet (undefined), (2)set to nothing (null), (3) set to a valid value
* Operations: "+" is interesting
* Function arguments: (1) too many: extras ignored, (2) too few: remainders get an undefined value
* Lists (a.k.a., arrays)
* _(Almost)_ everything in JavaScript is an object_ https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9108925/how-is-almost-everything-in-javascript-an-object
